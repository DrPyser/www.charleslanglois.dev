Here's the thing: I'm building this website.  
I have a few ideas on what I'd like to put on it, and other things I'd like to do with it.

For the content, among other things, I'd like to
* talk about music, like listing my favourites, reviewing some of them, inventoring my CD collection...
* talk about my favourite cinema & tv
* talk about tech projects I find interesting
* talk about the evolution of the website itself

This post is part of that last category, which should all be tagged #meta.

Beyond content, I'd like to integrate my website into the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), both technically and in principle.
A free and open web is something I strongly support, and the technical challenge is motivating.

I've started on this track already, by adding [*rel="me"* links to my other online identity profiles](http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth)(see the icon links at the top right corner). 

Next, I'd like to
* Add support micropub API to use apps to publish and manage my posts
* Add full indieauth support
* Add an h-card to my homepage.

Might create a page to track these ideas, something like a checklist or even an embedded issue tracker.

I'll try to make a new post on each major milestone.

*Peace out.*
