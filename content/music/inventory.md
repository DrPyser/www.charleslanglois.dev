This page is a work-in-progress inventory of my music collection.

I mostly collect CDs. I find this medium strikes a good balance between the tangible, physical and retrocool aspects, the practical considerations of collecting(form and size factor) and compatibility with the digital world(the CD itself stores digital information that can easily be extracted on a computer).  
Vinyls are nice, but are more bulky, require more costly equipment(for quality playback), and require more effort to digitalize.

I currently own(at the time of this writing) a few hundred CDs, a dozen or so Vinyls and a handful of cassette tapes.

## CDs

* I'm With Stupid by Aimee Mann
 

## Vinyls

* Animals by Pink Floyd

## Cassette Tapes

## Digital
(Excluding rips from previously listed physical media)
