My name is Charles Langlois.
This is my interweb homepage.

## About me

I am from Quebec, and currently living in Montreal.  
My mother tongue is French(as in "French Canadian"). I also speak English more or less fluently.  

I am a tech enthusiast, though I am currently most comfortable working with software.  
I studied computer science at Université de Montréal, and have been working as a programmer for about 4 years.

My other interests include music, cinema (movies & tv shows), litterature(as in "I read some books I like, I'd like to read some more sometimes").

## About this website

Right now, this might not look like much. I hope to grow this website as my own small real estate in the digital space.

While most personal content is now created and published through social networks, a personal website offers complete ownership and control over both the content and the presentation(at the cost of more effort and a bit of money).  
This is my first real attempt at building my own personal webspace in this way, on my own personal domain. The possibilities are endless!

For now, I plan to add content relevant to my interests, add links to my other online digital personas, and publish this site's content to other alternative webspaces, like IPFS and hyperdrive.

I also plan to make this website [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/)-compatible.
