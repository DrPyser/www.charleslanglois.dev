## About me

My name is {{< ehcard >}}Charles Langlois{{< /ehcard >}}.

I am from Quebec, currently living in the Gatineau area.

My native language is French (as in "Canadian French", or "Québécois").
I also speak English more or less fluently, depending on the day.

I am a tech enthusiast, with a focus on the software world.
I studied computer science at **Université de Montréal**, and have been working as a programmer/software developer since 2017.

My other interests include music, cinema (movies & tv shows), literature (mostly sci-fi), science, philosophy.

## About this website

I'm planting my flag, building myself a home in the digital landscape!

While most personal content is now created and published through social media platforms and other third-party hosted web platforms, a personal website offers a more complete ownership and control over both the content and the presentation (at the cost of a bit more effort, and a few bucks). And the only limit over what I can do with it is how much time and effort I'm willing to invest, and that cost has been driven down a lot since the early days of the web.

This is my first real attempt at building my own personal site, on my own personal domain, on my own virtual private server. The possibilities seem endless!

I plan to add content relevant to my interests, add links to my other online digital hangouts, and publish this site's content to other alternative webspaces, like IPFS, hyperdrive.

I also plan to make this website [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/)-friendly.
I want to support an open and free web which promotes diversity and freedom of content, user experience and technological foundation, through practical interoperability for the good of the people.
Software, the internet and the world should not be a group of fiefdoms ruled by giant megacorporations like in 80s sci-fi movies and cyberpunk stories.
