My name is Charles Langlois.  
This is my web homepage.

## About me

I am from Quebec, and currently living in the city of Montreal.  
My primary natural language is French(as in "French Canadian"). 
I also speak English, more or less fluently.

I am a tech enthusiast, though I am currently mostly comfortable working with software.  
I studied computer science at **Université de Montréal**, and have been working as a programmer for about 4 years.

My other interests include music, cinema (movies & tv shows), litterature(occasionally, I'm not a big reader yet).

## About this website

Right now, this might not look like much. I hope to grow this website as my own small real estate in the digital space.

While most personal content is now created and published through social media or other third-party hosted web services, a personal website offers a more complete ownership and control over both the content and the presentation(at the cost of more effort and a few bucks).  
This is my first real attempt at building my own personal webspace this way, on my own personal domain, on my own virtual private server in *the cloud*. The possibilities are endless!

I plan to add content relevant to my interests, add links to my other online digital personas, and publish this site's content to other alternative webspaces, like IPFS and hyperdrive.

I also plan to make this website [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/)-compatible.
