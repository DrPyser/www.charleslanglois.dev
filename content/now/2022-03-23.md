It's been a while since my last post. How about a new section for unstructured summary of things I find relevant in my life right about *now*.

* Still working @Accenture. Hey, it pays the bills. Mostly.
* Working on setting up personal self-owned services for storage, DNS, network traffic anonymity/security, infrastructure automation. Because it makes me feel less powerless.
  * [NAS](link/to/NAS/blog-posts)
  * [Home and personal DNS](link/to/DNS/blog-posts)
  * [Home network infra management](...)
  * [VPN for Vultr VPS & Home Network access](...)
  * [VPS configuration management/OS migration]
  * [Nix, NixOS]
  * [Service discovery]
  * [Monitoring, log storage & analysis]
  * Setting up my own email server.
    See e.g. [this nice blog post](https://zach.bloomqu.ist/blog/2021/07/reliable-self-hosted-email.html) which gives me hope, or if I remain too lazy there's [an easier way](https://mailinabox.email/). 
* Exploring of operating system concepts and low-level programming
  * Rediscovering Plan9, 9P and derivatives(Plan B, Octopus): distributed systems through centralized abstractions
  * Working on a 9P protocol implementation in Rust(Rust learning opportunity!)
  * Plumber/Plumber-like implementation in Haskell(maybe later in Rust and using 9P)
* Hoping to also get back on my indiewebification quest and work on this website.
  * Still planning to work on micropub, webmentions support, embedding microdata in website, ...
  * Thinking about hosting a stream-of-thought section for music, or anything I feel like sharing without much effort. Would replace my habit of sharing songs on facebook.
    This probably depends on me setting up an easy way to create small posts from my phone(see above cf. micropub)
  * Improving general look and UX of site.
  * Adding more links to relevant digital identities; better way to present them.
  * Still need to work on my CD collection inventory/music knowledge base.
  * Add more media. Some nice pictures.
  * Stream of relevant thoughts.
  * Some dynamic elements? Ways to interact? Some minimal non-invasive analytics to see if anyone ever comes here?

I should make a few posts to give details on some of these points.
