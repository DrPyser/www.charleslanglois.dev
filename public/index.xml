      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: I&amp;rsquo;m building this website.
I have a few ideas on what I&amp;rsquo;d like to put on it, and other things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do with it.
For the content, among other things, I&amp;rsquo;d like to
 talk about music, like listing my favourites, reviewing some of them, inventoring my CD collection&amp;hellip; talk about my favourite cinema &amp;amp; tv talk about tech projects I find interesting talk about the evolution of the website itself  This post is part of that last category, which should all be tagged #meta.</description>

      <description>This page is a work-in-progress inventory of my music collection.
I mostly collect CDs. I find this medium strikes a good balance between the tangible, physical and retrocool aspects, the practical considerations of collecting(form and size factor) and compatibility with the digital world(the CD itself stores digital information that can easily be extracted on a computer).
Vinyls are nice, but are more bulky, require more costly equipment(for quality playback), and require more effort to digitalize.</description>

      <description>My name is Charles Langlois.
This is my web homepage.
About me I am from Quebec, and currently living in the city of Montreal.
My primary natural language is French(as in &amp;ldquo;French Canadian&amp;rdquo;). I also speak English, more or less fluently.
I am a tech enthusiast, though I am currently mostly comfortable working with software.
I studied computer science at Université de Montréal, and have been working as a programmer for about 4 years.</description>
